HANGMAN HELP:

MENU NAVIGATION:
	To navigate menus in Hangman simply enter the first letter of the option you choose.
	This each valid option will appear in the menu surrounded by a pair of parentheses.
	For example: (P)lay
	To play the game simply enter P or p.
	Hangman accepts longer input but only the first character is considered in program logic.
HOW TO PLAY:
	In hangman you try to guess a word character by character.
	During gameplay enter one character at a time as a guess.
	You may input more than one character but only the first character will be considered.
	During each game you have a number of guesses based on difficulty.
	On easy you will have enough guesses to try almost every character possible.
	When you guess correctly you will not lose any of your remaining guesses.
	However, should you guess incorrectly you will lose one remaining guess.
	If you run out of guesses you lose the game.
	If you complete the word before that you will win.

MODIFICATION:
