The WEST is full of vicious criminals, bandits, and highwaymen. 
These outlaws threaten peace in the WEST but you couldn't care less.
You've come to the small town of Black Gulch for one reason and one reason only.
To make money.
Lots of money.
Each of the outlaws here will fetch a high price if you can capture them. 
For a bounty hunter like you that's more than enough of a reason to hunt them down.
